Hello!

This is a forum app I made using Rails and Devise. It has upvoting, user login, encryption, and link authorization.

How to run this app

git clone into a local directory

cd into repository

Run bundle install

Run bundle exec rake db:create

Run bundle exec rake db:migrate

Run rails server

Go to localhost:3000/ via your browser.

Please email me with any questions at christophermamian@gmail.com
